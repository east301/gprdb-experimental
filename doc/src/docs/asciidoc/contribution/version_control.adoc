Version control
---------------

Workflow
~~~~~~~~

gprdb project uses https://git-scm.com/[Git] as version control system.
Several workflows are proposed, and gprdb uses slightly modified version of
https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/[GitHub flow].

Original GitHub flow performs deploys directly from master branch and don't have "release" branch.
This style might be suitable where products are released or deployed frequently,
however, gprdb won't release or deploy products frequently.
Therefore, we prepare release branch to maintain release version of gprdb products.
