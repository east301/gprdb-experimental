Use of key value store
----------------------

gprdb shiped with key-value store abstraction layer. If you need key-value store,
use `KeyValueStoreManager` and `KeyValueStore` in `jp.ac.tohoku.ecei.sb.gprdb.io` package.

[WARNING]
====
Current implementation uses http://www.mapdb.org/[MapDB] as underlying backend,
however, underlying implementation might be changed in feature release.
====

Usage of key value store is very simple.
