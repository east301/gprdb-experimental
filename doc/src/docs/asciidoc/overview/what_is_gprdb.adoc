What is gprdb?
--------------

`gprdb` is a framework to construct databases of relations of pairs of genes.
A lot of biological data, such as gene coexpression, protein-protein interaction etc.,
are represented as set of pairs of two genes.
`gprdb` aims to provide the way to easily summarize and analyze such kind of data.

The figure below shows a simplified version of gprdb's architecture.

....

gprdb accepts two kinds of inputs: gene-pair relation data (gene coexpression, protein-protein interactin, etc.)
and 2) gene annotation data (gene ontology, pathway, etc.).

When two types of data is given, gprdb loads them into internal datastore, and merges them.
Then, several human-friendly views, such as gene-pair relation table, are automatically generated.
In addition viewer feature, users can be analyze gene-pair relation data interactively.
Analysis recipes can be extended using "plugins".
